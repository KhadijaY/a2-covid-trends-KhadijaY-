Reflection:
What does each row represent in each dataset?
How many features(columns)are there for each dataset?
What did you learn about the dataset when you calculated the state with the lowest cases (and what does that tell you about testing your assumptions in a dataset?
 What did you learn about the dataset when you calculated
Is the location with the highest number of cases the location with the most deaths?If not, why do you believe that may be the case?
 Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable 
# `lowest_in_each_state` (i.e., wouldn't you expect the number to be ~50)?
 What surprised you the most throughout your analysis?
