What does each row represent in each dataset?
They represent the dates,county, state,flips, cases, and deaths.

How many features(columns)are there for each dataset?
For the national dataset there are five columns. 
The state dataset has seven columns and the county dataset has seven columns as well.

What did you learn about the dataset when you calculated the state with the lowest cases (and what does that tell you about testing your assumptions in a dataset?
The state with the lowest cases was Northern Mariana Island and from getting my answer, it showed that there arent many people from this state, which is a small island with a small population contracting covid. By testing my assumptions I am able to prove that I have drawn correct conclusions based on the test, it showed that my assumptions were valid. 
 
Is the location with the highest number of cases the location with the most deaths? If not, why do you believe that may be the case? 

 
 Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable  
# `lowest_in_each_state` (i.e., wouldn't you expect the number to be ~50)?

What surprised you the most throughout your analysis?
I was most suprised at the ways we can analyse data and find the faults in our datasets.
